## Features

- **Wake Word Detection**: Activates the assistant using a specific wake word.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Capable of understanding and responding in numerous languages.
- **Conversational AI**: Employs OpenAI's GPT models for generating intelligent responses.
- **Language Switching**: Allows users to switch the assistant's language dynamically.

### Running EveryLinguaAI

To start EveryLinguaAI voice assistant, execute:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Usage

To begin interacting with EveryLinguaAI, activate it by saying the wake word "Hey Red" or any other wake word you've configured. Once activated, follow these steps to engage in conversation:

1. **Language Selection:** After activating the voice assistant, specify the language you want to use for the conversation. Simply say the name of the desired language in the language you are currently interacting with. For example, if you want to converse in Spanish, say "espa√±ol" or "Spanish." You can also switch languages at any time during the conversation by saying commands like "change language," "another language," or "different language" in either the current language or English.

2. **Asking Questions:** After selecting the language, you can proceed to ask questions or give commands. Here are some examples of commands:
   - "What is the tallest mountain in the world?"
   - "Can you tell me some facts about pyramids?"
   - "Do aliens exist?"
   - "Is AI going to take over?"

3. **Language Switching:** If you wish to switch languages during the conversation, simply utter one of the predefined language-switching commands in the language you are currently using or in English. The voice assistant will prompt you to specify the new language, allowing you to seamlessly transition between languages as needed.

4. **Ending Interaction:** To stop asking questions and deactivate the voice assistant, say commands like "stop listening," "no more," "that's all," or "nothing else." You can reactivate the voice assistant at any time by saying the wake word again.

Feel free to explore the capabilities of the EveryLinguaAI by asking questions, switching languages, and interacting in various scenarios. Enjoy the convenience of a versatile and multilingual conversational experience with EveryLinguaAI Voice Assistant!
